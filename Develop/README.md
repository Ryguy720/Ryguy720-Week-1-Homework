# Ryguy720-Week-1-Homework
This is week 1 homework

WELCOME!

For this homework I have consolidated various repetitive lines of code in the style.css sheet and the HTML file. Ive done this by adding more specific tags to the HTML so that the code more clearly represents which elements are being affected on the page. Additionally I've removed excess and repetetive classes from both the HTML file and the CSS file. As a result the webpage maintained the same appearence with a more effeciant and concise code.
